Project Shadows was a basic website to help enhance the learning experiance.
Here are valuable information as well as contact information. The idea of the
website was for students to be able to communicate with each other and
lectors on topic they cannot understand or have questions of.

There is a resource page where resources like study guides can be shared to the
students to help prepare them for their exams.
