CTU Buddy, a collaborative effort by Tayla Potgieter, Philip Potgieter, and Sebastian van Zyl, is an outstanding project that aimed to enhance the learning experience for students. As a basic website, CTU Buddy served as a valuable platform for students to connect and communicate with both their peers and lecturers.

One of the notable features of CTU Buddy was its resource page. This section provided a space where students could share study guides, notes, and other useful resources to support their exam preparation. By facilitating the sharing of knowledge and study materials, CTU Buddy fostered a sense of community and collaboration among students, promoting a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Additionally, the website offered valuable information and contact details, ensuring that students could easily reach out to their lecturers or fellow classmates for assistance. This feature reinforced the idea of a supportive learning environment, enabling students to seek clarification and guidance on topics they were struggling to understand.

CTU Buddy stands as a testament to the dedication and innovative thinking of its creators. By harnessing the power of technology, Tayla Potgieter, Philip Potgieter, and Sebastian van Zyl successfully developed a platform that not only facilitated communication but also enriched the learning experience for students attending CTU.
